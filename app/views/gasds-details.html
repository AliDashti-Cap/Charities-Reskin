      The GASDS is for small cash donations of £20 or less that the charity or Community Amateur Sports Club that you do not have a Gift Aid declaration for. It only applies to donations you have received since 6 April 2013.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you are only claiming under Gift Aid you must not complete any of the boxes on this page. You should return to the 'Repayment Claim Details' screen and answer 'No' to the question' Are you claiming under GASDS?'
