          You have selected to claim a repayment of tax on Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme (GASDS) donations collected in your community building(s). If you do not want to make this type of claim, you can remove it by answering ‘No’ to the question 'Are you claiming for donations collected in community buildings?’ in the <a href="http://localhost:3000/about-the-charity" class="govuk-link">Claim details</a> page.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
         The community buildings schedule is for small donations of £30 or less that were collected by a charity in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-detailed-guidance-notes/chapter-8-the-gift-aid-small-donations-scheme#community-buildings" class="govuk-link">community building</a>. CASCs cannot claim under the community buildings rules.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
         To make a claim, you must fill out a GASDS community buildings spreadsheet. Your claim spreadsheet must include details of the community building(s) in which the donations were collected and the amounts collected.
      </p>
