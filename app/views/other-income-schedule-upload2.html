        You have selected to claim a repayment of tax on other income donations. If you do not want to make this type of claim, you can remove it by answering ‘No’ to the question ‘Are you claiming UK tax deducted from other income?’ in the <a href="http://localhost:3000/about-the-charity" class="govuk-link">Claim details</a> page.

      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>bank and building society interest </li>
        <li>interest from government stocks</li>
