                Choose 'Yes' if the charity or Community Amateur Sports Club (CASC) is connected to another charity or CASC under the Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme rules. The connected charities and CASCs that claim a top-up payment for the year will share the maximum £1,250 payments limit for the tax year.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Please note:</strong>
                To submit your claim, you'll need to have your completed HM Revenue and Customs schedule of connected charities (prepared by your charity for the Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme) ready to attach when requested during the claim process.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can download the schedule as a spreadsheet from the GOV.UK website. All connected charity details which are required entries on the spreadsheet should be completed.

                Select 'Yes' if an error was made in a previous claim which caused the charity or Community Amateur Sports Club to receive an over-payment of Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme to which it is not entitled. The over-claimed amount will, where possible, be deducted from this claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where this is not possible, if for example the over paid amount is more than the repayment claim you are making, then you will need to make an additional payment to HM Revenue & Customs.
