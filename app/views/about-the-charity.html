            <p>
              To be eligible to make a claim under GASDS, your charity or CASC must have claimed Gift Aid:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>in the same tax year as you want to claim GASDS</li>
              <li>without getting a Gift Aid or GASDS claim penalty in the last 2 tax years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You must claim for top-up payments under the GASDS within 2 years of the end of the tax year that the donations were collected in.
            </p>
            <p>
              For GASDS claims, you must claim by tax year, not based on your accounting periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              GASDS donations can be in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>cash</li>
              <li>contactless card payments you collected on or after 6 April 2019 </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can claim up to 25% of GASDS donations. The maximum donation total you can submit a claim for under the GASDS in one tax year is £8,000. Your charity or CASC would recieve a payment of £2,000 from a maximum £8,000 GASDS claim.

                If this is the case, the tax overclaimed can be inputted in the ‘Previously over-claimed amount’ box of a spreadsheet. Make sure to enter the amount of tax overclaimed and not the total value of the donations.

                If the overpaid amount is less than the current repayment claim, it will be deducted from the total amount of this claim.

                If the overpaid amount is more than the repayment claim you are making, then you will need to make an additional payment to HMRC.
