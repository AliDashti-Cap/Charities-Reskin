            <p>
              To be eligible to make a claim under GASDS, your charity or CASC must have claimed Gift Aid:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>in the same tax year as you want to claim GASDS</li>
              <li>without getting a Gift Aid or GASDS claim penalty in the last 2 tax years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You must claim for top-up payments under the GASDS within 2 years of the end of the tax year that the donations were collected in.
            </p>
            <p>
              For GASDS claims, you must claim by tax year, not based on your accounting periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              GASDS donations can be in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>cash</li>
              <li>contactless card payments you collected on or after 6 April 2019 </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can claim up to 25% of GASDS donations. The maximum donation total you can submit a claim for under the GASDS in one tax year is £8,000. Your charity or CASC would recieve a payment of £2,000 from a maximum £8,000 GASDS claim.

                Some claims can have errors in which a charity or CASC receives more than their entitled amount for a GASDS claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this is the case, the tax overclaimed can be inputted in the ‘Previously over-claimed amount’ box of a spreadsheet or the appropriate field within the service. Make sure to enter the amount of tax overclaimed and not the total value of the donations.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the overpaid amount is less than the current repayment claim, it will be deducted from the total amount of this claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the overpaid amount is more than the repayment claim you are making, then you will need to make an additional payment to HMRC.
