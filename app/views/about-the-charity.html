          <p>
            To be eligible to make a claim under GASDS, your charity or CASC must have claimed Gift Aid:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>in the same tax year as you want to claim GASDS</li>
            <li>without getting a Gift Aid or GASDS claim penalty in the last 2 tax years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You must claim for top-up payments under the GASDS within 2 years of the end of the tax year that the donations were collected in.
          </p>
          <p>
            For GASDS claims, you must claim by tax year, not based on your accounting periods.
          </p>
          <p>
            GASDS donations can be in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>cash</li>
            <li>contactless card payments you collected on or after 6 April 2019 </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can claim up to 25% of GASDS donations. The maximum donation total you can submit a claim for under the GASDS in one tax year is £8,000. Your charity or CASC would recieve a payment of £2,000 from a maximum £8,000 GASDS claim.
